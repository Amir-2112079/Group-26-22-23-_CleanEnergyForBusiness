Following the latest technology news can also be invaluable to help you implement new innovations in your business.\r\n                                        <br />\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    <img className='photo' src='images/innovation.jpg' height={200} width={400} alt='Innovation'/>\r\n                    <br /> <br />\r\n                    <h2>Sustainable UK Companies</h2>\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    <h3>Aerial Power</h3>\r\n                    London-based Aerial Power has created a drone-based system for cleaning solar panels. The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is self-flying, making the system more efficient, cheaper, and more environmentally friendly than traditional cleaning methods. It could have big implications for solar farms in arid regions of the world, where there is an abundance of sun but the build-up of dust prevents the panels from working properly.\r\n                    <br /> <br />\r\n\r\n                    <h3> Ananas Anam</h3>\r\n                    Ananas Anam created Piñatex, a natural and sustainable textile produced from pineapple leaves. The production of leather and synthetic alternatives is damaging to the environment; Piñatex is made from a natural agricultural waste product, creates low water use and low production waste, and contains no harmful chemicals or animal products.\r\n                    <br /> <br />\r\n\r\n                    <h3>BBC Earth</h3>\r\n                    Following the global success of Blue Planet II, BBC Earth teamed up with Mother of Pearl to launch a sustainable fashion brand at this year’s London Fashion Week. From June, a line of evening wear made from organic silk and inspired by nature will be sold at Net-a-Porter.\r\n                    Much of Blue Planet II focused on the impact we are having on the world’s oceans. The fast fashion industry alone causes a huge amount of damage to the planet – and this is just one of the brands which offers shoppers an alternative.\r\n                    <br /> <br />\r\n                    <img className='photo' src='images/bbcearth.jpg' height={200} width={400} alt='BBC Earth'/>\r\n                    <br /> <br />\r\n                    <h3>Bio-bean </h3>\r\n                    bio-bean recycles waste coffee grounds to make Coffee Logs. Each carbon neutral log is made from the grounds of 25 cups of coffee and burns 20% hotter and longer than kiln-dried wood. Repurposing coffee waste generates 80% less emissions than if the grounds go to landfill. bio-bean’s ethos is that there is no such thing as waste – only resources in the wrong space.\r\n                    <br /> <br />\r\n                    <h3> Green Tomato Cars</h3>\r\n                    Green Tomato Cars are out to clean up the Big Smoke. Having been the first taxi operator to use the Toyota Prius way back in 2006, they are now pioneering fully zero-emission corporate transport with the UK’s largest fleet of hydrogen fuel cell EVs. As London’s eco-friendly taxi service, the company has a fleet of 600 hybrid vehicles which together complete 10,000 journeys a week. As an added bonus, the cars’ (limited) emissions are offset by the company’s project in Uganda which subsidizes fuel-efficient cookstoves. They also plant almost 200 trees a year as a community initiative.\r\n                    <br /> <br />\r\n                    <img className='photo' src='images/GTC.jpg' height={200} width={400} alt='GTC'/>\r\n                    <h3>One Planet Pizza</h3>\r\n                    Whatever your thoughts on veganism, the facts remain: the meat and dairy industries are accelerating climate change. Yet the thought of giving up pizza… it’s almost too much to contemplate.\r\n                    Enter: One Planet Pizza, the UK’s first frozen vegan pizza company. One Planet Pizza adds nutritional boosts to its pizzas, uses compostable and carbon neutral boxes, and produce pizzas with 45% of the carbon footprint of non-vegan pizzas.\r\n                    <br /> <br />\r\n                   \r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default RealLifeExamples;"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAO,sCAAsC;AAC7C,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AAAC;AAG1B,SAASC,gBAAgB,GAAG;EAExB,oBAEI;IAAK,SAAS,EAAC,MAAM;IAAA,wBAC7B;MAAK,KAAK,EAAC,YAAY;MAAA,uBACrB;QAAK,KAAK,EAAC,WAAW;QAAA,wBACpB;UAAA,UAAI;QAA4B;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAK,eACrC;UAAA,UAAI;QAAe;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAK;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA;IACpB;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACF,eACM;MAAK,SAAS,EAAC,MAAM;MAAA,wBACrB;QAAA,UAAI;MAAyC;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAK,eAC9C;QAAA,UAAK;MAAmC;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAK,eAE7C;QAAG,SAAS,EAAC,YAAY;QAAA,WAAC,wUAI1B;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAM,eAEF;UAAA,UAAI;QAAwB;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAK,iZAIjC;UAAA,UAAI;QAAa;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAK,gUAItB;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAM,KAAC;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAM,eACb;UAAK,SAAS,EAAC,OAAO;UAAC,GAAG,EAAC,iBAAiB;UAAC,MAAM,EAAE,GAAI;UAAC,KAAK,EAAE,GAAI;UAAC,GAAG,EAAC;QAAe;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAE,eAC3F;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAM,KAAC;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAM,eACb;UAAA,UAAI;QAAa;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAK,gbAItB;UAAA,UAAI;QAAgC;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAK,4VAIzC;UAAA,UAAI;QAAsC;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAK,iWAI/C;UAAA,UAAI;QAAgC;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAK,qVAIzC;UAAA,UAAI;QAAmB;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAK,0VAER;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAM,eAC1B;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAM,eACN;UAAK,SAAS,EAAC,OAAO;UAAC,GAAG,EAAC,uBAAuB;UAAC,MAAM,EAAE,GAAI;UAAC,KAAK,EAAE,GAAI;UAAC,GAAG,EAAC;QAAY;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAE,eAC9F;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAM,KAAC;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAM,eACb;UAAA,UAAI;QAAwB;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAK,eACjC;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAM,eACN;UAAA,UAAI;QAAY;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAK,+aAErB;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAM,KAAC;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAM,eAEb;UAAA,UAAI;QAAY;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAK,8VAErB;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAM,KAAC;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAM,eAEb;UAAA,UAAI;QAAS;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAK,6gBAGlB;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAM,KAAC;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAM,eACb;UAAK,SAAS,EAAC,OAAO;UAAC,GAAG,EAAC,qBAAqB;UAAC,MAAM,EAAE,GAAI;UAAC,KAAK,EAAE,GAAI;UAAC,GAAG,EAAC;QAAW;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAE,eAC3F;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAM,KAAC;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAM,eACb;UAAA,UAAI;QAAS;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAK,6XAElB;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAM,KAAC;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAM,eACb;UAAA,UAAI;QAAkB;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAK,qmBAE3B;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAM,KAAC;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAM,eACb;UAAK,SAAS,EAAC,OAAO;UAAC,GAAG,EAAC,gBAAgB;UAAC,MAAM,EAAE,GAAI;UAAC,KAAK,EAAE,GAAI;UAAC,GAAG,EAAC;QAAK;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAE,eAChF;UAAA,UAAI;QAAgB;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAK,gcAGzB;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAM,KAAC;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAM;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAEb;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QAGF;EAAA;IAAA;IAAA;IAAA;EAAA,QACJ;AAEd;AAAC,KAxFQA,gBAAgB;AA2FzB,eAAeA,gBAAgB;AAAC;AAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
