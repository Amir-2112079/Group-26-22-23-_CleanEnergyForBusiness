                <p className='paraghraph'>
                Due to changing public opinion and changes in government legislation running your business in a sustainable way is no longer a matter of preference. 
                More and more customers want the brands they choose to engage with to be eco-friendly. 
                Acting sustainably is becoming a defining factor in a company’s commercial viability.

                    <h3>Boost Your Brand’s Image</h3>

                    Promoting a positive brand image and brand awareness is a critical part of marketing your business. By focussing on green practices in your business, you will prove to customers that you are a company that cares. Unethical or unsustainable practices are seen as unforgivable among many consumers nowadays, so being able to prove that you are the opposite will significantly boost your brand image.

                    <h3>Improve Sales</h3>

                    Going hand in hand with an improved brand image, green practices will help improve sales. The stronger your brand, the more recognition it will get, and the more customers will flock to your doors. In addition, by focussing on green matters, you will attract more customers who only shop with sustainable businesses.

                    <h3>Reduced Costs</h3>

                    Many sustainable practices have the knock-on effect of cutting business costs. This includes making business premises more energy-efficient and recycling unwanted materials rather than sending them to landfill. In addition, you can save money by using more effective, sustainable items like recycled polythene. For more information on sustainable packaging, find out more from the eco-friendly packaging experts at Polythene UK.

                    <h3>Benefit From A Happier Workforce</h3>

                    Working for an ethical company can significantly improve your employees’ satisfaction in their roles. In addition, many green practices can have an incredible impact on your office working environment. For instance, by adding plenty of greenery to your office, you improve air quality while boosting the mood and productivity of your team.

                    <h3>Gain A Competitive Edge On Your Rivals</h3>

                    Adopting the latest and most innovative green practices can help give you a competitive edge over your business rivals. Many businesses have been slow to adopt sustainable practices, potentially costing them in terms of new business and reputation. By innovating immediately, you will set yourself apart and see an increase in your competitive edge.

                    <h3>Become Eligible For Green Grants</h3>

                    There are plenty of green grants and funding that the government offers to businesses that meet the eligibility requirements. These grants can fund essential tools, equipment, technology and cash for companies that want to improve their green credentials. This can make becoming green even more lucrative and attractive for any business.

                    <h3>Increase Innovation</h3>
                    Coming up with new ways to reduce waste can be challenging, but it can also lead to significant innovation in your business. Consider putting a team together to develop new sustainable solutions for issues your business faces. Following the latest technology news can also be invaluable to help you implement new innovations in your business.

                    <h3>Aerial Power</h3>
                    London-based Aerial Power has created a drone-based system for cleaning solar panels. The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is self-flying, making the system more efficient, cheaper, and more environmentally friendly than traditional cleaning methods. It could have big implications for solar farms in arid regions of the world, where there is an abundance of sun but the build-up of dust prevents the panels from working properly.

                    <h3> Ananas Anam</h3>
                    Ananas Anam created Piñatex, a natural and sustainable textile produced from pineapple leaves. The production of leather and synthetic alternatives is damaging to the environment; Piñatex is made from a natural agricultural waste product, creates low water use and low production waste, and contains no harmful chemicals or animal products.

                    <h3>BBC Earth</h3>
                    Following the global success of Blue Planet II, BBC Earth teamed up with Mother of Pearl to launch a sustainable fashion brand at this year’s London Fashion Week. From June, a line of evening wear made from organic silk and inspired by nature will be sold at Net-a-Porter.
                    Much of Blue Planet II focused on the impact we are having on the world’s oceans. The fast fashion industry alone causes a huge amount of damage to the planet – and this is just one of the brands which offers shoppers an alternative.

                    <h3>Bio-bean </h3>
                    bio-bean recycles waste coffee grounds to make Coffee Logs. Each carbon neutral log is made from the grounds of 25 cups of coffee and burns 20% hotter and longer than kiln-dried wood. Repurposing coffee waste generates 80% less emissions than if the grounds go to landfill. bio-bean’s ethos is that there is no such thing as waste – only resources in the wrong space.

                    <h3> Green Tomato Cars</h3>
                    Green Tomato Cars are out to clean up the Big Smoke. Having been the first taxi operator to use the Toyota Prius way back in 2006, they are now pioneering fully zero-emission corporate transport with the UK’s largest fleet of hydrogen fuel cell EVs. As London’s eco-friendly taxi service, the company has a fleet of 600 hybrid vehicles which together complete 10,000 journeys a week. As an added bonus, the cars’ (limited) emissions are offset by the company’s project in Uganda which subsidizes fuel-efficient cookstoves. They also plant almost 200 trees a year as a community initiative.

                    <h3>One Planet Pizza</h3>
                    Whatever your thoughts on veganism, the facts remain: the meat and dairy industries are accelerating climate change. Yet the thought of giving up pizza… it’s almost too much to contemplate.
                    Enter: One Planet Pizza, the UK’s first frozen vegan pizza company. One Planet Pizza adds nutritional boosts to its pizzas, uses compostable and carbon neutral boxes, and produce pizzas with 45% of the carbon footprint of non-vegan pizzas.
